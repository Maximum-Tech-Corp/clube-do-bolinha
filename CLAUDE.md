# Clube do Bolinha — Developer Guide

PWA for organizing amateur football (futsal/soccer) groups. Admins manage teams, draws, and tournaments. Players access via shared code and confirm attendance.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) |
| Database + Auth | Supabase |
| Payments | Stripe |
| Deploy | Vercel |
| UI | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS |

## Rules

**No unit tests.**

**Code**
- Clean code, self-explanatory names
- No unnecessary comments — only comment complex algorithms or non-obvious business logic
- Avoid N+1 queries and unnecessary re-renders

**TypeScript**
- Always typed — no `any`
- Use Supabase types from `src/types/database.types.ts`
- When adding DB columns via migration, manually update the types file

**Next.js**
- Prefer Server Components and Server Actions
- Client Components only when needed (interactivity, local state)
- Never expose secret keys on the client
- Auth proxy lives in `src/proxy.ts` — do NOT use `middleware.ts`

**UI**
- shadcn/ui as component base
- Mobile-first design

## Database

Migrations in `supabase/migrations/`. Applied manually via Supabase SQL Editor.

**Key tables:**
- `admins` — links Supabase auth user to team; holds `subscription_status`, `stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_subscription_id`
- `teams` — belongs to admin; has `access_code`, `match_duration_minutes`
- `players` — belongs to team; has `stamina`, `weight_kg`, `is_star`, `is_banned`, `suspended_until`
- `games` — belongs to team; statuses: `open` → `finished` / `cancelled`; flags: `draw_done`, `is_tournament`
- `game_teams` — teams created after draw
- `game_team_players` — players in each team with `goals` and `assists`
- `game_confirmations` — player confirmations; statuses: `confirmed`, `waitlist`, `declined`
- `tournament_matches` — phases: `group`, `semi`, `final`
- `player_stat_adjustments` — retroactive stats per year

**Supabase clients:**
- `createClient()` — uses anon key, respects RLS (for auth checks)
- `createServiceClient()` — uses service role key, bypasses RLS (for all data ops)

---

## Auth & Access Control

- Admin auth via Supabase Auth (email + password)
- Player access via team `access_code` in URL (`/jogador/[code]`) — no login required
- Player identity stored in cookie `player_{teamId}` = phone number
- Proxy (`src/proxy.ts`) protects `/dashboard/*` routes and redirects logged-in users away from `/login`
- Subscription gating: `admins.subscription_status` must be `active` to access dashboard (checked per-page, not in proxy)

---

## Stripe

- Webhook endpoint: `POST /api/webhooks/stripe`
- Handled events: `checkout.session.completed`, `invoice.payment_failed`, `customer.subscription.deleted`
- `checkout.session.completed` → sets `subscription_status = active` + saves `stripe_customer_id` + `stripe_subscription_id`
- `invoice.payment_failed` / `customer.subscription.deleted` → sets `subscription_status = inactive`
- To grant free access to an internal account: set `subscription_status = 'active'` directly in Supabase SQL, or create a Stripe subscription with a 100% off permanent coupon

---

## Draw Algorithm (`src/lib/draw-algorithm.ts`)

Balances teams by `weight_kg` + `stamina` + `is_star` distribution. Supports 2–5 teams. One team may be incomplete (odd player count). `getDrawInfo(n)` returns `{ canDraw, canBeTournament, message }`.

---

## Tournament

Group phase matches auto-generated after draw (round-robin via `buildGroupMatchOrder`). Semi and final created manually by admin after group phase completes. `computeStandings()` calculates the group table.

---

## Attendance Calculation

`attendanceRate` = confirmations with status `confirmed` or `waitlist` in finished games ÷ finished games that occurred **after** the player's `created_at`. Applied in `listPlayers()` and rankings page.

## Environment Variables

## Deployment

- Hosted on Vercel (Hobby plan)
- Stripe in test mode during E2E validation; switch to live keys in Step 17b
- After any env var change in Vercel → Redeploy required
- Supabase Authentication → URL Configuration must include production URL in Redirect URLs
